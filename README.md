# Phi

The Golden Ratio

## Background

My boyfriend (afrazer) and I live in a small shoebox apartment in NYC. We don't have much space for interior decor, but we do have some blank screens we'd like to use more effectively.

This project uses the Met Museum API combined with Google Arts & Culture to beautify our blank screens.

## Packages & setup 

Requires python 3.7 & several compatible packages: tkinter, pillow, requests. Display using eog.

To run: first grab all images using a search query 
```
python grab_paintings.py
search query: <input art movement>
```

Then to display:
```
source beautify.sh <input art movement>
```

Only tested on Fedora 29 workstation
