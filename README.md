# Background

My boyfriend and I live in a small, shoebox apartment in NYC. We don't have much space for interior decor, but we do have some blank screens we'd like to use more effectively.

This repo uses the Met Museum API combined with Google Arts & Culture to beautify our blank screens.

# Packages & setup 

Python 3.7, tkinter, pillow 

Only tested on Fedora 29 workstation
